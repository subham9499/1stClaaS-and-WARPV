# VADD Example

This example is a minimalistic example of how to construct a hardware-accelerated web application utilizing this repository. It can be used a starting template using `make copy_app APP_NAME=<new-name>`.

The hardware kernel performs an identical function to the Xilinx example kernel created from their RTL Kernel Wizard. It simply adds one to vectors of integer values.

The web front-end is simply the default front-end test bench from the framework.
